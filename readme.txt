Display a side tab that you can easily link to any page. Customize the tab text, font and colors. It's that simple. That's Simple Side Tab.

== Description ==

Add a "Global Call To Action" on your website. Simple Side Tab adds a vertical tab to the left side of the browser window that links to any page. The tab stays in place as your visitor scrolls down the page so it's always visible and ready for action. Works great on Mobile too.
